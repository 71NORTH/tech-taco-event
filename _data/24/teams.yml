  topic: Topic
  description: I am an economist focused on game theory in environmental economics, overlapping with topics in public economics and sometimes mechanism design. I think about externalities and complicated real-world linkages can be expressed and understood via economic modeling, as well as how agents large and small can form agreements to promote positive (reduce negative) externalities. I also consider how to make theory approachable and enjoyable for all students, grad and undergrad, major or non-major. All this requires an openness to innovation and transdisciplinary collaboration, and a willingness to try new approaches to get from idea to execution. I hope to continue flourishing in my pursuit of economic research, education of the public, and development of personal knowledge and skills.
